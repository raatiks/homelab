# üõ°Ô∏è Windows Attack Detection Lab

This project simulated both a brute-force and a network-based attack in a Windows environment, capturing logs using Sysmon, WinEventLog, and Firewall logs, and visualizing them with Splunk.

## üîß Lab Components
- **Kali Linux VM**: Used to simulate attacks (Hydra, Nmap, and Metasploit)
- **Windows 10 VM**: Target endpoint with Sysmon and Splunk Forwarder installed
- **Windows Server 2019 VM**: Hosts Splunk Enterprise

## üß™ Attack Scenario
- Brute-force login attempt via Hydra
- TCP port scanning via Nmap
- Reverse shell execution via Metasploit

## üìä Dashboards

### 1. Brute Force Detection
- **Sourcetype**: `WinEventLog:Security`
- **Panel 1**: Timechart of failed logins
- **Panel 2**: Top 5 targeted usernames
- **Panel 3**: Top IPs for failed logins

### 2. Sysmon Process Monitoring
- **Sourcetype**: `WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
- **Panel 1**: Timechart for all processes
- **Panel 2**: Top 10 processes by name
- **Panel 3**: Parent-child process pairings
- **Panel 4**: Most common command-line arguments

### 3. Firewall Log Monitoring
- **Sourcetype**: `WinFirewallLog`
- **Panel 1**: Timechart of firewall events
- **Panel 2**: Top blocked destination ports
- **Panel 3**: Top source IPs
- **Panel 4**: Allow vs drop comparison

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
Detailed configuration for Splunk, Sysmon, and log forwarding is in [`setup_instructions.md`](setup_instructions.md).

## üì∏ Screenshots
Dashboards, VM configs, Splunk searches, and attack terminals are available in their respective folders: [`dashboards/`](dashboards/), [`VM_settings/`](VM_settings/), [`search/`](search/), [`kali_terminal/`](kali_terminal/).

## üîç What This Lab Demonstrated
This lab helped me understand how to:
- Simulate realistic attacks
- Capture multi-source telemetry
- Build effective detection content in Splunk
